README file for deuterium spectral tube analysis taken July 10th 2025 by an SR4 OceanOptics Spectrometer designed to analyze plasma discharge and perform emission line analysis.
Runs are taken with the product between integration time and "scans to average" (number of runs) kept constant.
The Balmer optical emission series in particular is being studed.

Crystal Notes:
DG - refers to a focus on the Delta and Gamma Balmer lines
Files are named according to integration time of the spectrometer

Spectrometer Notes:
Active Pixel range: 0-3647
Wavelength range: 220 nm - 1050 nm
SNR (Single scan at 10 ms): 250:1
Dynamic range for single acquistion: 1300:1
Integration time range: 3.8 ms - 10 s
Scan type: 74 Hz
Spectrometer resolution: 0.2 nm

Unresolved problems:
1. Jin's deuterium data has a peak offset ~ 0.5 nm taken November 2024. Crystal's deuterium data has a peak offset ~ 1.0 nm taken in July 2025. Spectrometer calibrated October 2024 and requires yearly re-calibration. 

2. Unknown significant tailing of peaks and emergence of false double peaking of emission lines.

3. Coherent noise in spectrum background between various runs and various integration times

To be considered effects:
1. Broadening effects: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2017.12.027

2. Scaling of emission peaks varies greatly depending on ion produced
